# priority
<p> It's a C++ program to implement the CPU Scheduling Algorithm: <br> 
        Priority Algorithm non-preemptive to solve any type of priority problems.
        <br> 
        The main goal of the project is to improve my theoretical,technical,<br>
        and practical skills in Operating Systems.

    <ul>
        <li>Program ask the user about the number of processes.</li> 
        <li>Processâ€™s arrival time, burst time, and priority number are <br>
            defined by user during run time.</li>
        <li>The right sequence of processes is printed according to <br>
            the priority of each process. </li>
        <li>The program calculate the waiting time for each process <br>
             and the average waiting time for all processes. </li>
        <li> it draws the Gantt chart also </li>
    </ul>
